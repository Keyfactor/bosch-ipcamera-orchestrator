## Overview

The Bosch IP Camera Universal Orchestrator extension facilitates the remote management of cryptographic certificates for Bosch IP Cameras via Keyfactor Command. Bosch IP Cameras use certificates to secure communications, including HTTPS, EAP-TLS client authentication, and TLS-DATE client authentication.

A defined Certificate Store for the Bosch IP Camera Store Type represents a collection of certificates managed on a particular Bosch IP Camera. These Certificate Stores allow administrators to perform inventory operations, add or remove certificates, and manage certificate lifecycles effectively on remote cameras. By leveraging the orchestration capabilities of Keyfactor Command, this Universal Orchestrator extension ensures that all certificates remain up-to-date and compliant with security policies.
